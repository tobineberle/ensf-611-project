    "Avalanche forecasting is the practice of observing current and historical snowpack conditions to make educated guesses about how reactive the snowpack is, and thus the likelihood of avalanches. It is a mixture of an art and a science where field observations and a forecaster's experience generally have a lot of weight in the final avalanche rating for a particular area. This project will investigate the classification of avalanche ratings for each of the three avalanche zones in Yoho National Park (Canada), to determine how accurately we can determine the likelihood of avalanches solely based on weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference the avalanche danger ratings are as follows:\n",
    "- No Rating: Summer, or no snow in the mountains.\n",
    "- Spring Conditions: Very variable avalanche conditions based on the fluctuation of temperature throughout the day making it difficult to forecast.\n",
    "- Low: Generally safe avalanche conditions.\n",
    "- Moderate: Heightened avalanche conditions.\n",
    "- Considerable: Dangerous avalanche conditions.\n",
    "- High: Very dangerous avalanche conditions.\n",
    "- Exterme: Extraordinarily dangerous avalanche conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The avalanche zones are split into three seperate areas:\n",
    "- Below Treeline (btl): Elevation of a mountain band that is covered by forest.\n",
    "- Treeline (tln): Sparse forest cover and is the transition between uniform forest cover below it and the alpine above it.\n",
    "- Alpine (alp): Wide expanses of open, exposed terrain with few or no trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note there is a  difference between the avalanche zones as they each obtain a seperate rating from eachother."
